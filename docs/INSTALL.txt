Configuration:
--------------
Once you've logged in to your administrator account, your next step should be changing
the EQdkp configuration settings.  Click on the 'Administration Panel' link in the top
menu, and then on the 'Configuration' link in the left frame.  This is where you can 
control all of EQdkp's settings.

Most of the fields have descriptions where appropriate, but some need to be reinforced.

    Site Name:
        Optional, appears in a large font above the menu of each page.  Usually it's something like
        'Guild Point System'.

    Site Description:
        Also optional, appears below the site name in a smaller font.  Usually a short tagline or a
        URL to the guild's official web site.

    Point Name:
        Some guilds may find the use of the 'DKP' acronym archaic (or even stupid) and may wish to change
        their point system name to something else.

    Enable Account Activation:
        None - Everyone who registers is given an account and automatically set up with the default 
            permissions (see below).
        User - A user must validate their e-mail address in order for the account to become active.
        Admin - The administrator must approve the account personally for it to become active.

    Enable Gzip Compression:
        If your PHP installation supports Zlib, you may consider using this option.  It compresses
        the output of pages to save you some bandwidth, but may use slightly more processing power.
        
    Default Permissions:
        Probably the MOST important thing you'll set up here.  When a person comes to your EQdkp site and
        isn't logged in, you may not want them seeing what your guild has killed in the last couple of
        days, or who got what item.
        
        These default permissions are also given to people when they register and can only be changed by
        an administrator with the 'Manage Users' permission.  Items in bold text should only be given
        to trusted members of your guild who will be responsible for maintaining the point system.
        
    Cookie Settings:
        For 99% of the installations, the default values should be sufficient.
        

    Default Game:
    If you are running something other than EverQuest for your game, you'll need to change it
    now.  Select WoW, Everquest2, or any of the other games available.

    Backup Database:
    This will take you to an add-on that will let you back-up your eqdkp database without having to 
    use phpMyAdmin - very useful if you don't have access to the box after the admin leaves the 
    guild, no?  Can also be used to restore a database - so be very careful as there are no
    special permissions needed for this functionality - admin access allows access to backup (this
    is intentional)

Have Fun!
